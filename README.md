# rpi_weather
Weather API for Raspberry Pi

# Usage
This project uses Python 2.7, modules required for proper execution include: pyowm, PIL, urllib, cStringIO, Tkinter.

All you need to use this program is **git clone** and **python gui.py**

I strongly encourage anyone to change the **Open Weather API key** to their own.
